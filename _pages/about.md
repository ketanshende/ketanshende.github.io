I am an agricultural engineer and applied researcher focused on precision agriculture, field-deployed sensing systems, and grower-centered technology adoption.

My work combines engineering, field trials, and outreach to support practical solutions for row and specialty crop systems. I have led research and development across autonomous spraying platforms, wireless communication infrastructure, UAV imaging workflows, and postharvest sensing applications.

## Current Focus
- Translating precision agriculture research into deployable tools for growers and ag-industry stakeholders
- Evaluating sensing, automation, and AI workflows under real production conditions
- Building bridges between research teams, startup technologies, and commercial farming operations

## Education
- PhD, Biological & Agricultural Engineering, Kansas State University (2024)
- MS, Electrical Engineering, Texas Tech University (2019)
- BE, Electronics & Telecommunications Engineering, University of Mumbai (2015)

## Selected Experience
- General Manager (R&D), Reservoir Farms, Salinas, CA (Sep 2025 - Jan 2026)
- Postdoctoral Research Associate, UF/IFAS Indian River REC, Fort Pierce, FL (Sep 2024 - Sep 2025)
- Graduate Research Assistant, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS (Jan 2020 - Aug 2024)

## Technical Areas
- Precision agriculture systems and field experimentation
- Wireless data communication and GNSS-enabled platforms
- Agricultural sensing, imaging, and data analysis (Python, MATLAB)
- Extension-style outreach and stakeholder engagement
