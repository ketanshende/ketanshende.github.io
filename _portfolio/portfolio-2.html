Conducted applied postdoctoral research to evaluate sensing and AI workflows for citrus quality assessment in real-world postharvest environments.

Key outcomes:
<ul>
  <li>Built and evaluated machine learning workflows for disease-related fruit feature analysis</li>
  <li>Collaborated with field and postharvest teams to align methods with production needs</li>
  <li>Supported translational research goals for Florida citrus stakeholders</li>
</ul>
