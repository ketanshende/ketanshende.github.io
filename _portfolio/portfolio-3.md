title: "Spray Coverage and Droplet Analysis Pipeline"
excerpt: "Built a MATLAB image-processing pipeline to quantify PWM spray coverage and droplet-size distribution using water-sensitive cards."
collection: portfolio
---

Designed an image-processing workflow to support sprayer evaluation studies by extracting spray deposition metrics from field trial imagery.

Key outcomes:
- Standardized analysis across multiple research projects
- Improved repeatability of coverage and droplet-uniformity reporting
- Supported publication and extension communication of sprayer performance findings
